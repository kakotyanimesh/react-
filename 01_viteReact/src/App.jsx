// notes from the first class
// react is a library , which is difference from a framework : in framework rule is must , but in library rule doesnot matter that much 
// we have to use react@vite : less code then regular react, command is : npm create vite@latest
// npx : node package execute  
// npm : node package manager 
// read the package.json  
// <></> => this is known as fragment 



// import syntax : import fuction-Name from './filename'
